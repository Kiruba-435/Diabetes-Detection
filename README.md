# Diabetes-Detection

## Description:

This project is to develop a predictive model that accurately identifies individuals at risk of diabetes based on various health-related features. The model will be built using **Support Vector Machine algorithms**, which are known for their ability to handle complex datasets and provide accurate predictions.

## Tech Stack:

Language:  Python 

Algorithm: Support Vector Machine Classification

Tools:  Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.
 
## Methodology:

###   Data Collection:
- Gather a dataset containing health-related features and diabetes status from reliable sources such as medical databases or public health records.

###   Data Preprocessing:
- Handle missing values and categorical variables.
- Normalize or standardize numerical features wherever required.

###   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Visualize the distribution of health-related features and diabetes status.
- Identify correlations between features and diabetes.
- Generate insights that can guide feature selection and engineering.

###   Model Training:
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Train a machine learning model on the training set.
- Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using accuracy, precision, and recall.
